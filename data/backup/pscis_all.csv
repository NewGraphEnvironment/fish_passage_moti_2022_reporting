Culvert has been replaced with horizontally drilled pipe. Outlet of the culvert is embedded 80 cm. It is only the top 2 1/2 m of pipe that is not fully embedded with natural substrate. Although this culvert may score as a barrier with the Provincial metric conditions within the pipe are very similar to those upstream within the natural step-pool channel.,pscis_phase1.xlsm,1017501664,,,AI,17501664
